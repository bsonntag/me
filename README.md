## Requirements

This project requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed.
I also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install dependencies instead of Npm,
but it's not required.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the dependencies with `yarn install`.

## Development

This website is built with Parcel.
A local server for development can be run with `yarn start`.
It will run on port 1234, so you can access it on http://localhost:1234.

## Build

To build the website for production run:

```js
$ NODE_ENV=production yarn bundle
```

## Contributing

Please feel free to submit any issues or pull requests.
